These tests are designed to be run on a desktop python3 install, not
on the ESP8266 itself. The 8266 does not have the testing libraries to
run these tests (and perhaps not enough memory).

The idea is that you develop on a desktop, run the tests, and then copy
the files over to the ESP8266 device.
