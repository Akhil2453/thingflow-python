ThingFlow-Python
================
ThingFlow is a (Python3) framework for building IoT event
processing dataflows.[#]_  The goal of this framework is to support the
creation of robust IoT systems from reusable components. These systems must
account for noisy/missing sensor data, distributed computation, and the need for
local (near the data source) processing.

The source repository for ThingFlow-python is at https://github.com/mpi-sws-rse/thingflow-python

Sections 1 and 2 of this documentation cover how to get started. Sections 3
through 6 cover more advanced topics. Finally, Section 7 contains reference
documentation for the API (extracted from the docstrings).

.. [#] *ThingFlow* was originally known as *AntEvents*.
